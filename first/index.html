<!-- The index.html and the associated index.css files serve to approximately recreate the image contained on the png file.  As I have written the code, the browser image will closely match the png image when the browser is opened to a similar shape found on the png, however the image is stretched if the browser is fully opened, due to various reasons including my use of vw and vh when setting the shape sizes in index.css which allows for the screen to stretch -->
